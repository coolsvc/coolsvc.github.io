> Welcome to my personal blog, a space dedicated to the realms of network transport optimization and distributed systems.
> As an SRE with years of experience, I've consistently focused on a wide range of topics, including networking, edge computing, and operations frameworks. This blog serves as a repository for my thoughts and experiences in business refinement, architectural evolution, and practical tooling. My goal is to distill complex technical problems into clear, understandable insights, and I hope to spark new ideas through conversations with fellow professionals.
> Beyond technical articles, you'll also find some of my reflections on products, life, and the world at large.
